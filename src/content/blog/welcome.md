Hey, welcome to my blog! 🎉

I'm a computer engineering student and I've decided to start documenting my projects and things I'm learning. Writing helps me solidify concepts, and maybe this will be useful to someone else too.

## What to expect

I'll be posting about:

- **Embedded systems projects** - microcontrollers, sensors, making things blink
- **Low-level programming** - C, assembly, understanding what's happening under the hood
- **Random experiments** - whatever catches my interest
- **Tools and setups** - my dev environment, useful tools I find

## Why a blog?

A few reasons:

1. **Documentation** - future me will thank present me
2. **Learning** - explaining something forces you to understand it
3. **Portfolio** - a place to show what I've been working on

## The tech stack

This blog is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), a lightweight static site generator. It's fast, simple, and lets me write posts in Markdown. No JavaScript shipped to the browser unless I need it.

That's it for now. Let's see where this goes.

```c
int main() {
    printf("hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
